# Kanbanizer
!WIP!

Trello-inspired kanban-style _*OFFLINE*_ application.

Made using [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) and [StablexUI](https://github.com/RealyUniqueName/StablexUI).

Should leave this for now to think about redesign.
For now implemented:
- collapsable container like accordion
- drag-drop panels with placeholders
- nice (may be not) looking theme
- some number of custome components
